**What these files are for**  
These files are version-specific implementations related to account metadata discovery and filtering. They provide options to filter results by number of posts, follower counts, and account creation year.

**Note about use**  
These scripts must **only** be used for lawful, ethical, and permitted purposes (for example: research on accounts you own, testing with synthetic data, or administrative tasks for accounts you control). Do **not** use them to access, claim, or interfere with accounts that you do not own or have explicit permission to manage.
