# Jacking — Versioned Scripts

**Repository overview**  
This repository contains two version-specific Python scripts. They are provided for **educational, research, and legitimate account-management** purposes only. Do **not** use them to access, claim, or interfere with accounts you do not own or have explicit permission to manage.

---

## Files

- **`jacking3.12.py`** — Target runtime: **Python 3.12**.  
- **`jacking3.13.py`** — Target runtime: **Python 3.13**.

Each file contains implementation specific to the Python version indicated in its filename. Choose the file that matches your environment.

---

## Purpose (neutral description)

These scripts implement a workflow for discovering and filtering account metadata (for example: filtering by number of posts, follower counts, or account creation year). They are intended to be used for **legitimate** scenarios such as:

- managing or auditing accounts you own,  
- testing and research on synthetic or consented data,  
- defensive security work where you have explicit permission.

They are **not** intended for or to be used for unauthorized access, takeover, harassment, or any action that violates platform terms of service or applicable law.

---

## Usage (high-level, non-actionable)

- Inspect each script before running it so you understand what it does.  
- Run only in controlled environments and only against accounts and data you own or have explicit permission to manage.  
- Use environment variables or a secrets manager for any credentials; never hardcode sensitive information into repository files.  
- When testing, prefer synthetic data or isolated test accounts created specifically for that purpose.

> This README intentionally avoids operational examples that could be misused. Add a separate `USAGE.md` with non-sensitive examples if you need step-by-step guidance for legitimate uses.

## Configuration & Safety

- **Do not** store passwords, API tokens, or private keys in the repository.  
- Use environment variables or secure secret storage.  
- Log actions carefully and avoid storing or exposing personally identifiable information (PII).  
- When testing, prefer synthetic data or isolated test accounts.

## Legal & Ethical Notice (read before using)

**Do not use these scripts to access, claim, or otherwise interfere with accounts you do not own or have explicit written permission to manage.** Unauthorized access to online accounts is illegal in many jurisdictions and violates most platform terms of service.

By using this repository you affirm that your usage will comply with all applicable laws and the terms of service of any third-party platform you interact with. If you are doing research, obtain written permission from the account owner or use sanctioned testing programs offered by the platform.
